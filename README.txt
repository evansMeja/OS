# OS

#This is going to be my first OS, based initially on the youtube video series at
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4
#
#However, this is more of a personal exercise to get comfortable learning and using development tools
#Most people would see the project as a n00b idea because:
#I haven't really programmed anything worthwile yet
#I have never used the tools involved to create anythiing significant
#I have never managed an open source project
#I have spotty knowledge on all related subjects and no formal education on the matter
#
#Nevertheless, I think that's exactly why this project has to be done
#Is a "mostly focused" project 
#I like to learn on the go
#
#"...Knowing and not doing is ultimately not knowing..."
#
=====================================
Ver 0.0.1
#kernel.bin has been created, by now it does not do anything yet except displaying "hello"
#
#In order to run the OS grub has needs a menu item that points to kernel.bin
#kernel.bin can be generated by running:
#make kernel.bin
#
#For convenience, you can also create an iso image to be read in a virtualbox
#it is required to have grub-legacy, grub-pc-bin, xoriso
#to create the iso just run:
#make [image].iso
#
#make will cleanup temporary files after creating iso file
=========
I just downloaded port.h and port.cpp from github repo due to 2 main problems
1.File in repo is quite different to the one on video
2.I did try to make the one on video work but kept having errors at compilation due to assembler junk, will try to solve it trough stack overflow

I will keep my versions as portb inside the project hoping i can actually make it work to understand what happened, I've been trying to troubleshoot it myself but no luck, the main problem so far is that i don't really understand what the constraints in asm command do.
