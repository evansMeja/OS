# OS

#This is going to be my first OS, based initially on the youtube video series at
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4
#
#However, this is more of a personal exercise to get comfortable learning and using development tools
#Most people would see the project as a n00b idea because:
#I haven't really programmed anything worthwile yet
#I have never used the tools involved to create anythiing significant
#I have never managed an open source project
#I have spotty knowledge on all related subjects and no formal education on the matter
#
#Nevertheless, I think that's exactly why this project has to be done
#Is a "mostly focused" project 
#I like to learn on the go
#
#"...Knowing and not doing is ultimately not knowing..."

=====================================
Ver 0.0.1
#kernel.bin has been created, by now it does not do anything yet except displaying "hello"
#
#In order to run the OS grub has needs a menu item that points to kernel.bin
#kernel.bin can be generated by running:
#make kernel.bin
#
#For convenience, you can also create an iso image to be read in a virtualbox
#it is required to have grub-legacy, grub-pc-bin, xoriso
#to create the iso just run:
#make [image].iso
#
#make will cleanup temporary files after creating iso file
